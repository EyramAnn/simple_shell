SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT

Contributions: This is an ALX collaboration project on Shell between Antoinette Amedza and Selasie Gedjah.

Requirements: We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bourne Again Shell (BASH) be compiled using “gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh”. This project was completed using C language Shell Betty linter.

What we Achieved: This collaboration helped deepen our understanding of the C-programming language and Shell notwithstanding the few challenges we faced.
